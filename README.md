# Expanding-Cards

Expanding Cards is the first of 50 daily CSS/HTML/JavaScript Projects that I'm working through from Udemy.
This project creates a single web page that has several image links that expand on click and then display the title for each image.

## Setup Environment

Each Project has at least 3 starter files
```
index.html
script.js
style.css
```
